      <h3>ORIGINS</h3>
      <p>
        Musical theatre is a form of performing art that combines songs, spoken
        dialogue, acting, and dance. It evolved from operettas and vaudeville in
        the 19th century, particularly in the United States and Europe.
      </p>

      <h3>THE FIRST MUSICALS</h3>
      <p>
        The first musical is often considered to be <em>The Black Crook</em> (1866),
        which blended drama, dance, and music into a single narrative. This marked
        the beginning of the modern musical as a distinct art form.
      </p>

      <h3>THE GOLDEN AGE OF BROADWAY (1940–1960)</h3>
      <p>
        The period known as the Golden Age of Broadway produced classics like
        <em> Oklahoma! </em> and <em>West Side Story</em>, where music, dance, and story
        were seamlessly integrated. Legendary composers and lyricists defined the era.

      <h3>INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE</h3>
      <p>
        By the late 20th century, musicals became a global phenomenon with massive
        productions like <em>Les Misérables</em> and <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>.
        These shows expanded the emotional and visual scope of musical theatre.
      </p>

      <h3>CONTEMPORARY MUSICALS</h3>
      <p>
        Modern musicals such as <em>The Lion King</em>, <em>Wicked</em>, and
        <em> Hamilton</em> introduced cutting-edge technology, diverse storytelling,
        and innovative music styles such as pop, rap, and rock.
      </p>

      <h3>WHY MUSICALS WERE BORN</h3>
      <p>
        Musicals were created to merge emotional storytelling with the power of music.
        They allow audiences to feel deeply, celebrate life, and escape reality through
        harmony, dance, and vibrant expression.
      </p>

      <h3>FUN FACT</h3>

        <em>Phantom of the Opera</em> is the longest-running musical in Broadway history.
